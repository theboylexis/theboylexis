# 💫 About Me

👋 Hi, I’m **Alex Marfo Appiah**  
🚀 **Software Engineer transitioning into Backend & Full-Stack Engineering**

---

## 🧠 Overview

I build **production-ready web applications** with a strong foundation in **JavaScript and system-level thinking**.

After completing an intensive JavaScript learning phase, I am now **actively transitioning into backend engineering**, starting with **Node.js and Express**. My focus is on **server-side architecture, APIs, data flow, and clean, maintainable systems**, while still being capable of delivering complete full-stack products.

I care about how software works **under the hood**, not just how it looks.

## 🛠️ What I’m Currently Doing

- Transitioning fully into **backend development with Node.js and Express**
- Building **RESTful APIs** using proper routing, controllers, and middleware
- Learning **authentication, authorization, and backend security fundamentals**
- Working with **databases, data modeling, and persistence**
- Writing **clean, scalable JavaScript and TypeScript** for server-side systems
- Building **full-stack applications** that integrate backend services with React and Next.js
- Preparing for **junior backend and full-stack internship roles**

---

## 🎯 Goals for 2026

- Become highly competent in **Node.js, Express, REST APIs, and databases**
- Design and ship **production-ready backend systems**
- Build and deploy **end-to-end full-stack applications**
- Deepen understanding of **JavaScript internals and backend architecture**
- Maintain a **strong, backend-focused GitHub portfolio**
- Secure a **junior backend or full-stack engineering internship**
